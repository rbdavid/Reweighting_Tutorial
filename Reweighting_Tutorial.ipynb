    "# The Reweighting Tutorial\n",
    "So, you've done some enhanced sampling simulations where you applied a biasing potential to a certain collective variable. For whatever reason, you now want to quantify the free energy surface of the modeled event in a collective variable that is _not the biased CV_. Having applied an artificial bias to the simulations, you cannot simply calculate the probability density of this new CV and convert to free energy. Instead, each frame's weight in the probability density must be measured based on the weight that the frame received in the biased CV simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Steps:\n",
    "### 1) Run EMUS or WHAM to get stitching constants in the biased CV FE surfaces\n",
    "Before any analysis of the new CV can be done, we need to perform a free energy analysis (using either EMUS or WHAM; suggested to use EMUS) of the biased CV space to obtain the \"stitching\" or \"normalization\" constant for each window in the baised CV space. These constants are important for reweighting the biased CV sampling into a new collective variable space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running EMUS has been covered in a different tutorial (see https://mccullaghlab.okstate.edu/group-pages/tutorials/93-pages/402-emus). The code provided below will initialize a whole bunch of variables to be used throughout this tutorial as well as load in the results from EMUS, the biased CV data, and unbiased CV data. "

A number of bootstrapping iterations is performed where, during an iteration, $nValues$ of data is randomly pulled from the original collective variable data set.
